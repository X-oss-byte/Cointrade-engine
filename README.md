Coinify provides a hosted checkout user interface to enable the customer to make a payment regarding a specific PaymentIntent. Use the GET HTTP verb and redirect the customer to the paymentWindowUrl which is received in the successful response of this endpoint.

If you want to preselect a cryptocurrency before redirecting your customer to the Payment Window, first use this endpoint to create the PaymentIntent and get the URL, create a quote for the preferred cryptocurrency, and then redirect the end-user to the related paymentWindowUrl.

Successful Response

LAST UPDATED: MARCH 1, 2023
BLOCKCHAIN.COM GUIDE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT
LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES
Blockchain.com is only able to respond to valid requests addressed to one of its legal entities and issued by local authorities in which the addressed entity is located. The entities to which legal requests should be addressed and the countries in which they are located are as follows:
‚óè Lithuania: Blockchain (LT), UAB
‚óè Ireland: Blockchain Access (Ireland) Limited
‚óè British Virgin Islands: Blockchain.com (BVI) Limited
PLEASE NOTE if you are a law enforcement officer in a country outside of one of the countries listed above you will need to make a request for mutual legal assistance (MLAT) or submit letter rogatory to one of the above countries to request data from the associated entity. The above entities will only respond to a valid legal request issued by a local court or law enforcement agency from the country in which it is located.
Law enforcement agencies in Lithuania, Ireland, or the British Virgin Islands may submit requests directly to lawenforcement@blockchain.com.
LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES:
Law enforcement located within the United states may send (i) a valid subpoena issued in connection with an official criminal investigation for the disclosure of basic subscriber records (defined in 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2703(c)(2)); (ii) a valid court order; or (iii) a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal
  
Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures upon a showing of probable cause for the disclosure, if any, addressed to Blockchain.com, Inc.
Blockchain.com, Inc. will accept service of documents sent to lawenforcement@blockchain.com as a voluntary courtesy but reserves the right to object to such service in the future.
IF YOUR REQUEST INVOLVES IMMINENT RISK OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY HARM:
If you are a law enforcement agent requesting information from Blockchain.com that is likely to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm, you may contact us on an expedited basis. Together with the appropriate documents listed above, send an email to lawenforcement@blockchain.com with "IMMINENT RISK" in the title. In the body of the email, include a brief attestation describing the imminent risk, and Blockchain.com will try to respond on an expedited basis.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Does Blockchain.com respond to law enforcement information requests?
Yes. Blockchain.com will respond to valid law enforcement agency information requests. See above for instructions. Note that the most helpful pieces of information you can provide are a wallet identifier (e.g. 2td3t671-c54d-ds32-456t-65ftya3b24dd) or Exchange account details. Other data points, like a bitcoin address (e.g. 14eK8q8GXubF2Y9yegRyfpkVm63AsFcefb) or a transaction number (e.g. c1a3cec06316fb13bd0198afc8b15e6edc5123fc5d15383446cc9f3b43ca0734), are significantly less likely to return helpful information.
I can see, using Blockchain.com‚Äôs Block Explorer, that a transaction took place on the Bitcoin (or some other) blockchain. Does this necessarily mean that Blockchain.com‚Äôs products or services were responsible for the transaction?
  
No. Our Block Explorer displays information from public network ledgers. Blockchain.com publishes all of its transactions on these public ledgers, but it is only one of thousands of software products and services doing so.
I have a bitcoin address or transaction hash. Can Blockchain.com correlate this information with any personally identifying user information?
If the user simply downloaded and used Blockchain.com‚Äôs non-custodial wallet, no. But if the address or hash was used in a Swap or Exchange transaction, then Blockchain Access can correlate it to the user‚Äôs profile. Note, however, that Swap transactions are non-custodial. Thus, a user‚Äôs Swap transaction does not link the user in Blockchain.com‚Äôs records to other transactions made in the user‚Äôs non-custodial wallet.
I have the name, address, telephone number, or other identifying information of an individual. Can Blockchain.com correlate this information with other personally identifying information?
As in the answer above: If the individual is only a non-custodial wallet user, Blockchain.com is unlikely to have such information. If the individual is a user of Swap or the Exchange, Blockchain.com may be able to correlate the information with a user profile.
I have the private key or backup phrase associated with a bitcoin address. What information can Blockchain.com correlate to these data points?
None. Blockchain.com does not know private keys or backup phrases associated with any user wallets.
I have a non-custodial wallet identifier. Can Blockchain.com freeze or deliver virtual currency from that wallet?

No, Blockchain.com cannot access user‚Äôs wallets. Blockchain.com can, however, deliver certain industry-standard log information associated with the wallet, including creation date, login time, device ID, operating system, associated email address or telephone numbers (if used for 2-factor ID), together with any encrypted wallet file backed up using Blockchain.com‚Äôs servers.)
